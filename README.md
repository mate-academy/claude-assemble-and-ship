# qa-kit

A Claude Code plugin that adds code-quality tooling to your workflow.

## What it does

**Commands**

- `/qa-kit:summarize-changes` — Summarises every file touched on the current branch with a one-line description of what changed. Produces output short enough to paste directly into a pull-request description.

**Subagents**

- `code-reviewer` — Reviews recent code changes for bugs, missing error handling, and unclear names. Returns findings grouped by severity (high / medium / low), one sentence per item.

## Usage

Load the plugin from the repo root:

```
claude --plugin-dir .
```

Run the summarise command by its namespaced name:

```
/qa-kit:summarize-changes
```

Trigger the code reviewer by asking Claude naturally:

```
Review my recent changes.
```

After editing any plugin file, restart Claude Code and re-run `claude --plugin-dir .` to pick up changes.

If a component invokes a bundled script, always reference it via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` rather than a hardcoded path — otherwise the plugin breaks when loaded from a different directory.
